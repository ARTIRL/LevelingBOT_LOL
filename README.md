### 4. Notes and Warnings

- **Operating System Compatibility:** Currently, the bot only supports PCs with an English OS. If your OS is in another language, the bot may not function correctly.
- **Screen Path Issue:** Ensure that all required files (including the League of Legends shortcut and the `Images` folder) are placed on your desktop. If your system uses a different language, this may cause issues.
- **Risk of Banning:** While the bot is not currently detected by Vanguard, using third-party software always carries a risk of getting banned. Use the bot at your own risk. The developers are not responsible for any bans or penalties.

This project is open to issues and requests. If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to submit them via GitHub.
